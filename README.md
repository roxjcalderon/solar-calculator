# Getting Started with Solar Calculator App

This Solar Calculator app is a simple React app used to calculate the possible nominal power of an area selected.

Google Maps is leveraged to allow search functionality and map selection.

Create an .env file with a variable of REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY to run. REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY should be a valid api key that works with Google maps and has the Maps Javascript API and Places API enabled.
